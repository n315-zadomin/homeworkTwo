This assignment was pretty much wrapped around the MVC Model. With this model, it is easier to create dynamic web pages for a cleaner programming look. I definitely do enjoy this model, and it is a tool that I am glad we are able to learn in these courses. Similarly, working with the terminal is something I am glad to have learned. It took me a while to get the hang of, but I now am able to use this instead of using Prepros. The only difficulty I had this week was remembering simple things, such as linking script tags and css tags. I am not quite sure why this was the only thing I struggled with, but other than that everything went to work pretty smoothly.

For this assigmne t I pretty much just decided to base it off an album I really like. Since last week I recreated a website, I figured this time I would take a bit more of creativity and do something I liked. Overall I like how the website came out and think it worked out pretty well.
